About a month ago I left the following two comments on this video - Shelter, the Animation.

Forever my favorite music video.

[ shelter = my safeword - and the safeword I give to those who I teach the concept of safeword-based consent to ]

I'm never having kids - probably - vasectomy @ 21 years old and never regretted it (im 30, now).  

And I think a lot of people probably see this video and think it's about a father and his child and their relationship or something like that. And people might see me â€“ with the inability to have kids - and be like "he certainly can't understand this video" - HE DOESNT WANT KIDS. 

And to them I say the following: 

Just because you can't have biological children doesn't mean that you can't teach; 

"Daddy" is one one my favorite words.
